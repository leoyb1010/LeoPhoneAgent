#pragma mark - Fork memory guard

// [fork-guard] Stall guest fork() while the app's memory footprint is too high.
//
// Every guest process lives inside Minis.app's own address space, so a burst
// like `xargs -P 15` running 32MB Go binaries adds ~480MB to the app's iOS
// footprint and gets the whole app SIGKILLed by Jetsam.
//
// We measure phys_footprint (TASK_VM_INFO) — the metric Jetsam actually uses to
// decide what to kill. An earlier version of this guard used
// os_proc_available_memory() (remaining headroom) with a 400MB reserve, but on
// an 8GB device the per-process limit is ~1.5-2GB, so headroom never fell
// anywhere near 400MB and the guard never fired once. Measuring what we have
// spent, not what is nominally left, is the check that trips in practice.
//
// We *block* rather than returning _EAGAIN: busybox xargs (what the Alpine
// rootfs ships) does not retry a failed fork — it calls bb_simple_perror_msg
// and exits 126, silently dropping that work item. Blocking the forking thread
// applies the same backpressure without losing work: the guest simply sees a
// slow fork() and the burst self-throttles to what the device can sustain.
//
// Safe to block here: sys_clone calls the guard before task_create_ and holds
// no kernel locks at that point (pids_lock is taken later), and it runs on the
// guest thread that asked to fork, so only that thread waits.
//
// [T-ish-forkguard-stall] THRESHOLD AND GATING, after a field report of every
// trivial guest command (`true`, `echo hi`) taking a flat ~10s.
//
// The 500MB ceiling this replaces was derived in 59714a04 from a single
// `xargs -P 10` stress run that peaked at ~317MB, with a crash at ~358MB. That
// commit's own closing note — "Still unverified on device: whether the guard
// now actually engages ... That test is what would confirm the threshold is
// right" — is exactly what went wrong: the number was never checked against
// ordinary steady-state use on a large device.
//
// Two independent defects, both visible in field logs:
//
// 1. A DEVICE-INDEPENDENT CEILING against a device-dependent limit. Jetsam's
//    per-process budget scales with installed RAM, but 500MB did not. On a 4GB
//    iPhone 11 the app idles at 84-145MB and the guard never fires; on a 12GB
//    device it idles at 885MB-1.0GB and the guard fires on EVERY fork. Same
//    binary, same workload, opposite behaviour — the ceiling was calibrated on
//    one device class and silently mis-set for the other. Scaling off physical
//    RAM restores the intent (engage before the kill zone, stay out of the way
//    below it) on both.
//
// 2. A WAIT THAT NEVER DENIES ANYTHING. On timeout the guard logs and forks
//    anyway, by design — busybox xargs would drop the work item on a failed
//    fork. But that makes the 10s a pure delay, not backpressure: with a
//    footprint that is high because the app legitimately holds that much (not
//    because a burst is in flight), nothing is going to fall in 10s, so every
//    fork pays the full penalty and then proceeds regardless. Field log: 272
//    stalls, every one of them a timeout ending in "allowing fork anyway".
//
// The fix keeps the guard's real purpose — throttling a *burst* that is
// actively inflating the footprint — and drops the cost when there is no burst:
//
//   - Gate on system memory PRESSURE first. Waiting is only meaningful when the
//     OS is actually short of memory; the field logs show pressure=normal with
//     3-4.5GB free the entire time the guard was stalling. Under normal
//     pressure we allow immediately.
//   - Scale the footprint ceiling to the device, so "high for this hardware"
//     means the same thing everywhere.
//   - Cap the wait at 2s. The guard exists to let *exiting* guest processes
//     return memory; that happens in hundreds of milliseconds or not at all,
//     and since a timeout forks anyway, a longer wait buys nothing.
//
// Threads are exempt (handled in sys_clone) since they add no separate address
// space.
//
// Ceiling = 25% of physical RAM, clamped to [500MB, 2GB]:
//   4GB device  -> 1.0GB   (idle 84-145MB, so still far below — no change in
//                           behaviour for the class where the guard was quiet)
//   8GB device  -> 2.0GB   (clamp)
//   12GB device -> 2.0GB   (clamp; idle 885MB-1.0GB now sits below it)
// The lower clamp keeps a small device from setting a ceiling so low that
// ordinary operation trips it; the upper clamp keeps a large device from
// setting one so high the guard can never engage before Jetsam does.

/// address into a REAL host path `<sock_tmp_prefix><pid>.<socket_id>` and binds
/// that (`deps/ish/fs/sock.c:280`). The compiled-in default is `/tmp/ishsock`
/// (`fs/sock.c:229`), i.e. the iOS host `/tmp`, which no sandboxed app may
/// write. Every guest `bind()` therefore failed with EPERM: Terraform/OpenTofu
/// provider handshakes could never start (GH#175), and the minis-mcp-cli daemon
/// had to fall back to loopback TCP.
///
/// Upstream iSH fixed this in 2019 (`7704024a`) inside `app/AppDelegate.m`.
/// Minis does not compile that file — this class is its equivalent, and it
/// mirrors every other init from it (do_mount, DNS, exit_hook, tty_drivers,
/// create_stdio) EXCEPT this one line. So this is a re-alignment with upstream,
/// not a new mechanism, which is also why the fix belongs here rather than in
/// the cross-platform C core: `fs/sock.c` must not depend on Foundation, and
/// patching the fork there would conflict on the next upstream sync.
///
/// Notes for anyone touching this:
///   * `strdup` is load-bearing. `NSTemporaryDirectory()` returns an autoreleased
///     NSString; storing its `.UTF8String` in a global raw pointer would dangle
///     as soon as the pool drains.
///   * `NSTemporaryDirectory()` already ends in `/`, and `ishsock` is a FILENAME
///     PREFIX, not a directory — `sock.c` appends `<pid>.<id>` straight onto it.
///     Hence `stringByAppendingString:`, not `stringByAppendingPathComponent:`.
///   * Simulator is excluded, matching upstream: it is not sandboxed the same
///     way, and its container paths are longer (see the length check below).
///   * Must run BEFORE any guest process starts, since the prefix is read on
///     every bind. It is process-global and written once, so there is no
