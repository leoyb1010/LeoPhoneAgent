///      path; counters are lock-guarded integers whose uncontended cost is a
///      few instructions, not a syscall.
///   2. Everything here is callable from any thread. The hot paths that feed it
///      are guest threads inside the iSH kernel and background tool work, none
///      of which is main-actor isolated.
///   3. A missing reading is reported as absent, never as zero — a fabricated
///      0 would read as "no leak" and is worse than no data.
